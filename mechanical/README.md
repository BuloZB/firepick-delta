### 3-D Mechanical Design Directory

#### Summary / Context

This directory contains the mechanical files for  [FirePick Delta](http://delta.firepick.org).

#### File Format
These files were created in [Cubify Design](http://cubify.com/Products/Design).  Cubify Design is admittedly not an open-source program, and costs $199 to buy, with a 30-day free trial.  It gives about 50% of the functinoality of SolidWorks, for a fraction fo the price.

We would have loved to use an open-source program for FirePick Delta, but none of them were up to the job.  OpenSCAD, for example, still doesn't (easily) support fillets or other simple primatives.  HOWEVER, we are making the STL versions of these files available now, and will be offering converted versions of all of the mechanical files in this repo in other, more common 3d formats, in the near future, including STEP, IGES, SCAD, and others.  The basic idea is to design in Cubify and, when the files have stabilized, re-draw in industry-standard formats.  

If you're decent with mechanical design software, and would like to volunteer to help us with this effort, please get in touch with us at our [main website](http://delta.firepick.org).
