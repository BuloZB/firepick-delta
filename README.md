#### Contributions and Pull Requests
It's really hard to accept pull requests because they are "all or nothing" for binary files such 
as the Cubify files that make up a large portion of this repository. 
Instead, share your thoughts and links to your design changes in your own repository.
This will allow folks to incorporate your idea into their own designs or they can simply copy the file
from your own fork.
